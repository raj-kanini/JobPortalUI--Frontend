## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
- The [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.7. Install it using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```

## Development Server

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/beekinjobs.git
   cd beekinjobs
   ```

2. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server using the Angular CLI:
   Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

You can generate new components, directives, pipes, services, guards, interfaces, enums, and modules using the Angular CLI. Use the following command to scaffold a new component as an example:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

## Build

To build the project for production, use the following command:

```bash
ng build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Connecting to the Backend

- The Angular project is designed to interact with a backend API, which is provided in a separate repository named "JobPortalAPI--Backend."
- You can access the backend API by following this link: [JobPortalAPI--Backend](https://github.com/raj-kanini/JobPortalAPI--Backend).
- Ensure that the backend server is up and running and properly configured before connecting to it from the Angular project.

## Further Help

- For more help on using the Angular CLI, use the following command:

  ```bash
  ng help
